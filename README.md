## Project Overview

Efficient energy management requires accurate energy consumption prediction. This project applies regression techniques to model energy consumption, optimizing their performance using hyperparameter tuning.

The notebook in this repository demonstrates:

1. Data preprocessing.
2. Model development using Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regression.
3. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
4. Evaluation of model performance.

## Key Features

- Ridge regression for handling multicollinearity.
- Lasso regression for feature selection.
- ElasticNet regression for balancing Ridge and Lasso advantages.
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
- Model evaluation using metrics like RÂ² and Mean Squared Error.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations)

## Results

- The optimal hyperparameters for each regression method.
- Visualizations comparing model performances.
- Key insights into the importance of features for energy consumption prediction.
